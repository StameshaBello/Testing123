                  <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
                      <p>I am simply a young person that's new to this whole coding experience.
                      So far, I really like it and hope to continue learning more in due time.
                      I just graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a BSA degree
                      in biology. You may be wondering, "<strong>Why is she trying to code for a living
                      when she didn't even get a CS degree?</strong>" Well, you may find that out in
                      due time.</p>
                      <p>Apart from coding, I enjoy participating in a variety of creative outlets
                      such as sewing, creating digital art, crocheting, and--<strong><em>most importantly
                      </em></strong>--watching anime. I absolutely love everything about anime, from the
                      expressive speech utilized by voice actors/actresses to the amazing animation
                      brought to life by creators. I want to try my hand at cosplaying, but I haven't
                      quite gotten there yet.</p>

              <article id="past-experiences">
                  <h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>
                      <p><span style="background-color: maroon; border: thin solid gold;">Unfortunately, I do not have much work experience.</span> I worked at an eatery
                      called Kinsolving Dining, which was situated within a dorm of the same name
                      (minus the "dining" part, of course). When I worked there, I did a number of
                      tasks briefly, but I mainly bussed tables and worked at the cash register.
                      Since I only chose to work there for a semester, I'm sure you can deduce whether
                      if I enjoyed myself there or not.</p>
                      <p>Rather than focusing on my lack of official work experience, I'd like to
                      draw your attention to my <em>abundance</em> of real-life experience. <strong><em>What</em></strong> might that
                      be exactly? Well, I'd like to know the answer to that too. <span style="background-color: orange; border: thick solid darkblue">I have plenty of
                      experience being disappointed</span>, if that counts for anything. *sniffle*</p>
              </article>

              <article id="hobbies">
                  <h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
                      <p>Well, I <em>guess</em> I kind of addressed this section within the "About Me" portion,
                      huh? <strong>Oops</strong>. Though, I didn't <em>entirely</em> exhaust my list of hobbies up there. I didn't
                      mention that I like playing video games or cooking. Well, I guess I can't say that
                      I <em>particularly</em> enjoy cooking. It's more so that I get excited when I think
                      that a recipe will turn out great. (Of course, referencing my abundance of
                      <em>"experiences,"</em> I'm sure you can imagine how that usually turns out.)</p>
                      <p>I would particularly enjoy looking great if that were possible. Too bad I don't
                      have good-looking money. *sigh*</p>

    <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
      <p>I am simply a young person that's new to this whole coding experience.
      So far, I really like it and hope to continue learning more in due time.
      I just graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a BSA degree
      in biology. You may be wondering, "Why is she trying to code for a living
      when she didn't even get a CS degree?" Well, you may find that out in
      due time.</p>
      <p>Apart from coding, I enjoy participating in a variety of creative outlets
      such as sewing, creating digital art, crocheting, and--<b><i>most importantly
      </i></b>--watching anime. I absolutely love everything about anime, from the
      expressive speech utilized by voice actors/actresses to the amazing animation
      brought to life by creators. I want to try my hand at cosplaying, but I haven't
      quite gotten there yet.</p>

    <h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>
      <p>Unfortunately, I do not have much work experience. I worked at an eatery
      called Kinsolving Dining, which was situated within a dorm of the same name
      (minus the "dining" part, of course). When I worked there, I did a number of
      tasks briefly, but I mainly bussed tables and worked at the cash register.
      Since I only chose to work there for a semester, I'm sure you can deduce whether
      if I enjoyed myself there or not.</p>
      <p>Rather than focusing on my lack of official work experience, I'd like to
      draw your attention to my abundance of real-life experience. What might that
      be exactly? Well, I'd like to know the answer to that too. I have plenty of
      experience being disappointed, if that counts for anything. *sniffle*</p>

    <h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
      <p>Well, I guess I kind of addressed this section within the "About Me" portion,
      huh? Oops. Though, I didn't entirely exhaust my list of hobbies up there. I didn't
      mention that I like playing video games or cooking. Well, I guess I can't say that
      I <i>particularly</i> enjoy cooking. It's more so that I get excited when I think
      that a recipe will turn out great. (Of course, referencing my abundance of
      <i>"experiences,"</i> I'm sure you can imagine how that usually turns out.)</p>
      <p>I would particularly enjoy looking great if that were possible. Too bad I don't
      have good-looking money. *sigh*</p>
